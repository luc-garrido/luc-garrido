## Hey there! <img width="640" height="640" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c31cb5b-bdfb-4207-b967-183ca7bb582f" />

I’m Lucas, a Data Science and AI student based in Brazil.

I build things to solve real problems.

If something feels repetitive or inefficient, chances are I’ll try to automate it or improve it.

I currently work as an **AI Engineering Intern**, where I focus on improving **chatbot performance**, especially search quality, response relevance, and overall evaluation scores.

My main tech stack is Python, with a strong focus on data processing, automation, and applied AI. I’m particularly good at **improving retrieval, ranking, and optimization strategies for chatbots**.

I’ve got a few pinned projects, but one of my favorites is a tool that analyzes the text of PDF and DOCX files to detect duplicates and interactively ask whether to delete them.

I learn best by building, testing, and iterating on real systems.

Fun Facts:
I enjoy games and tech-related content  
I like understanding how things work under the hood  
I prefer practical projects over theory  
I’m always looking for ways to optimize systems
